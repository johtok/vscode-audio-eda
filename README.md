# audio_eda

Umbrella repository for audio-focused ML tooling, with a strong emphasis on exploratory data analysis (EDA).

This repo now tracks two planned sub-repos:

- `subrepos/python-toolbox`: Python toolbox for audio EDA + ML workflows
- `subrepos/vscode-extension`: VS Code extension for interactive audio inspection and dataset workflows

See `TODO.md` for the detailed roadmap and scope.
